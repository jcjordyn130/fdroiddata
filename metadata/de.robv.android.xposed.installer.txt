Auto Name:Xposed Installer
Summary:Xposed framework installer
Description:
Xposed is a framework for modules that can change the behavior of the
system and apps without touching any APKs. That's great because it
means that modules can work for different versions and even ROMs without
any changes (as long as the original code was not changed too much). It's
also easy to undo. As all changes are done in the memory, you just need
to deactivate the module and reboot to get your original system back.
There are many other advantages, but here is just one more: Multiple
modules can do changes to the same part of the system or app. With
modified APKs, you to decide for one. No way to combine them, unless
the author builds multiple APKs with different combinations.
